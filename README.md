# Climate Change and Environmental Disasters in Indonesia 🌏

## Overview  
This project explores and highlights the impact of climate change and environmental disasters in Indonesia, focusing on issues such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, sea level rise, forest fires, global warming, and ocean acidification. It combines **data-driven analysis** with an interactive **MERN stack-based website** to visualize and communicate findings effectively.  

The website provides a detailed overview of environmental disasters and includes visualizations of data related to earthquakes, volcanoes and floods.

## Work Done  

### 1. **Website Development**  
- Built using the **MERN stack**:  
  - **MongoDB**: For storing disaster-related data.  
  - **Express.js & Node.js**: For building backend APIs to fetch and process data.  
  - **React.js**: For creating an interactive and responsive frontend user interface.  
- Key features include:  
  - Visualizations of earthquake, volcano and flood data.  
  - Causes, Outcomes, Mitigations and Analysis of various environmental disatsers in Indonesia.  
  - Insights into the impact of global warming and ocean acidification.  

### 2. **Data Analysis and Research**  
- Conducted detailed analysis for **earthquakes**, **volcanic eruptions**, and **floods** using **Jupyter Notebooks**:  
  - Earthquake heatmaps, forecasting and patterns.  
  - Trends and impacts of volcanic activity.  
  - Flood frequency, forecasting and areas affected.  
- Implemented data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques for effective insights.

### 3. **Documentation**  
- Project Report and presentation outline the project's goals, methodologies, and findings.
